# Relax_Take-Home_Challenge

This project is part of the SpringBoard Data Science curriculum.
In this challenge, Relax, a company, is interested in determining
which of their customers will become "adopters". Machine Learning methods
are used to identify factors that will predict future user adoption, 
where an adopted user is defined as a user who has logged into the 
Relax site on three separate days in at least one sevenÂ­day period.
Data is provided in two csv files: one file has login times for each 
customer and the second file has customer data with various features
such as customer name and the organization they belong to.

Python code used for this project is provided in Juptyer Notebooks, and
a written report is provided as a pdf file.
